            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>The Community Family Life Center is a nonprofit organization dedicated to serving 
                the citizens of the Sugarbrooke community in Ypsilanti, Michigan. 
                The Center claims that a little more than half of the adolescent 
                population in Ypsilanti lives in poverty. Since its founding, 
                they have attempted to counter the economic disparity of their city by providing food, 
                educational resources, activities and partnership with several local and national organizations.

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p> This project was part of our studio based engineering psychology course 
                in which several students and myself collaborated to create potential solutions
                 to several important problems we identified in our world. The course began with an introductory 
                 period where we got to learn about each others strengths and weakness and participate in 
                 activities to stimulate our creativity. We then moved into the  “dreaming phase”  
                 where we spent a considerable time just discussing problems we’ve identified. After weeks of discussion 
                 we settled on the driving problem. We believe that if we can leverage existing and emerging 
                 technology with intuitive design we can drastically cut down the amount of casualties related to driving.

        <div class="current solution">
            <h2>Current Solution</h2>
            <p>We found that our problem can be solved simply through better design and innovation of existing and upcoming technologies. 
                For example while Blind Spot Warning Indicators are inherently useful devices, 
                if the device is designed to signal the driver as long as another car 
                remains to the side of the vehicle the driver can quickly become desensitized  
                to the indicator and ignore it when it is needed most. 
                We also found that while most car manufacturers rely on a 
                single method of signaling the user a multi-modality approach will give the best results. 
                In designing a lane keeping/ departure warning system by taking advantage of both visual, 
                tactile, and auditory stimuli each modality can make up for the constraints of the other. </p>

            <h2>Impact and Results</h2>
            <p>This project was presented to a team of professionals representing Delphi, 
                Infoscitex, and the Air Force Research Lab. 
                While the work done existed within the scope of a classroom 
                setting our work was used by the professionals represented to further 
                their respective fields of automation, aviation, and sensors.</p>
