            <h3>The Story</h3>
            <p>The city of Gainesville takes pride in being open and transparent allowing citizens to see, first hand, everything that goes into the governmental processes of the city. However, the average citizen struggles to make use of the confusing data portal rendering it under utilized. The city had tasked us with designing a game using the City's data to engage users.</p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>Conduct user research on the citizens' interests in Gainesville's finances. Make mockups/wireframes of the topic experience user-friendly, and interesting for users to engage in. Focus on the topic of the City of Gainesvilleâ€™s Open Data Portal to teach community members the purpose of this tool, how to use it, and how it can benefit them. Ensure there is an educational (LEARN), interactive (PLAY), and call-to-action (ACT) component to the product.</p>

            <h3>Project Solution</h3>
            <p>We designed a simple game scenario in which a user was frustrated with the current state of the city's finances. The user logged onto the learn play act game and was given the role of high commissioner, tasked with overseeing the city's budget. In our scenario, through the game, the user learns just how much goes into creating a sustainable city budget. </p>

            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>We followed a fairly straightforward design process to get to where we are today. First we conducted preliminary comparative analyses to gain an understanding of the city's problem and solutions used by cities with similar problems. From there we moved to rapid ideation brainstorming a number of potential solutions. From there we conducted need finding surveys to help us narrow down our approach. This lead us to creating user personas and scenarios for potential game ideas. From there we were able to select a working solution and device a user storyboard and interaction flow. </p>

            <h3>What's Next</h3>
            <p>The next step in our process is to create a gameplay interaction flow. From their we will design a low fidelity prototype to continue user testing. From there we will make several prototype iterations with increasing fidelity. The final deliverable will be a high fidelity prototype given to our client to advise them on the best path forward. </p>
