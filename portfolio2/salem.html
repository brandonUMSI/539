            <h3>The Story</h3>
            <p>In December of 2018 I accepted a role at Salem Church of God 
              as their resident of Outreach an Communications. I was tasked with 
              coordinating outreach and mission efforts as well as designing Salem's 
              new Web and app Interface</p>

            <h3>Constraints</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Time</li>
                <li>Money</li>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>Utilize a web management software to design a quick 
              and fast webpage and mobile app to be used to leverage social resources 
              to promote growth and volunteerism. Salem required a web and mobile platform that 
              would be easy for someone who is not extensively trained to be able to view, understand, 
              and make changes</p>

            <h3>Project Solution</h3>
            <p>Weighing all of our goals and constraints, I decided to use Subsplash,
               a church based web building platform that was cheap and would be fairly easy 
               for me to train staff with no prior experience. 
              </p>

        <div class = "des">
            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>I broke each aspect of the web and mobile design into easy to chunks
               focusing on each ministry area separately. One each chunk was completed
                I allowed members of our staff to test and provide feed back. Once a draft of the full 
                site and mobile app was finished I opened use up to the entire congregation along with a survey 
                to give us feedback on problems. Over the next few weeks I released several versions of the app 
                and website taking into account all the feedback.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "next">
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>Since it's deployment our app and website has seen over 1800 downloads. 
              Users have been able to utilize the app to interact with the church follow along with messages, 
              listen to podcast, communicate with each other, sign up to volunteer, schedule visits and so much more!</p>
