            <h3>Every good designer tells a story</h3>
            <p>I love music! As a musician, studying music has taught me a wealth of valuable lessons. 
                Particularly, music has taught me to seek to understand and empathize 
                with the human experience. A good performer is not just a musician. 
                 Good Musicians are story tellers. 
                 They learn how to understand the needs of their audience effectively, 
                 conveying information and emotion to anticipate and leverage 
                 the audience’s response. Just like music, being able to empathize with the
                  human experience is what makes a good designer.Travel is also a major interest 
                  of mine. Growing up a military brat, I spent much of my 
                  childhood moving from place to place. In my adult life I've kept up 
                  that same trend traveling for school, church, and leisure. In fact, 
                  so far I've been to 10 countries and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon!</p>

            <h3>My Problem Solving Process:</h3>
            <p>My approach to problem solving and design is a lot like my approach to music.
                 I break down my problem-solving process similar to the way 
                 I break down a practice session. First, I identify what is working. 
                 Then, I move on to what is broken, identifying what is failing or 
                 not meeting expectations. Next, I identify what is missing. 
                 I ask, “what needs to still be included, what can make this better.” 
                 Finally, I identify what is confusing, what I do not understand, and 
                 what needs to be accounted for. Once I have successfully completed 
                 that process, I have a good idea of what the problem is and what
                  possible solutions can be implemented.</p>
